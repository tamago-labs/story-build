## Overview

Traditional IP registration and licensing involves expensive legal processes, complex paperwork, and months of negotiation. Existing platforms often lack transparency, have high barriers to entry, and provide limited monetization options for creators.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** revolutionizes this by enabling natural language interaction with complex IP operations. Story.build leverages MCP to make IP protection and monetization as simple as having a conversation, while maintaining professional-grade legal frameworks through Story Protocol's programmable IP licensing system.

**Story.build** is a toolkit that acts as an interface between AI and **Story Protocol**, enabling the creation of a transparent IP value chain where creators get paid every time their work is built upon:

### **üé® 1. Original IP Creation**
```
Register artwork ‚Üí Attach license terms ‚Üí Ready for licensing
```

### **üé´ 2. License Token Purchase (for Derivatives)**
```
Want to create remix ‚Üí Buy license token ‚Üí Pay licensing fee ‚Üí Get permission
```

### **üîó 3. Derivative Work Creation**
```
Register remix as derivative ‚Üí Link to original ‚Üí Automatic royalty sharing
```

### **üí∞ 4. Revenue Flow**
```
Derivative earns money ‚Üí Original creator gets royalty ‚Üí Claim revenue
```

**Example:** Artist registers song ‚Üí Someone buys license for $100 + 10% royalty ‚Üí Creates remix ‚Üí Original artist automatically gets 10% of remix earnings!

Please note that the project is under development. Check out the video demo to see the current progress or refer to the following section for more details.

## Work with Local Files

When working with local files, especially when using the webapp generation tool to create complete Next.js applications on your machine, you'll need to import an additional MCP server library of `filesystem` made by the Claude team. Use with:

```json
"filesystem": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
    "${workspaceFolder}"
  ],
  "disabled": false
}
```

`workspaceFolder` refers to your working directory. You can provide more than one argument. Subfolders or specific files can then be referenced in your AI prompt.

If you're using Linux and encounter issues during setup, please refer to the troubleshooting section.

## Troubleshooting

If you're using Ubuntu or another Linux environment with NVM, you'll need to manually configure the path. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Story.build under your current NVM-managed Node.js version:**

```bash
npm install -g story-build
```

2. **Due to how NVM installs libraries, you may need to use absolute paths in your config.** Replace the example values below with your actual username and Node version:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "story-build": {
      "command": "/home/YOUR_NAME/.nvm/versions/node/YOUR_NODE_VERSION/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "/home/YOUR_NAME/.nvm/versions/node/YOUR_NODE_VERSION/bin/story-build",
        "--wallet_private_key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "--story_network=aeneid"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** and it should work now.
